                    <p><thick>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</thick> is a dystopian novel that reflects a number of fears in the 1960s.</p>

                    <p>Overall, the book discusses the fears associated with the potentially catastrophic outcomes of using nuclear weapons and the development of new technology, which were major concerns when the book was written during the midst of the Cold War.</p>

                    <h1>The <thick>Connnection</thick></h1>
                    <p>Although <thick>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</thick> and <thick>The Windup Girl</thick> were written in completely different eras, the books share a number of more profound similarities.</p>
                    <p><thick>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</thick> focuses on a number of topics that are directly related to the circumstances of society when the book was written, such as nuclear war and armament, the race to space, and the development of new technology.</p>
                    <p><thick>The Windup Girl</thick> does the same, exploring subjects that are more relevant to the 21<sup>st</sup> century, such as climate change, uncurable diseases, and developing biotechnology and its ethicality.</p>
                    <p>As is shown, both books take topics, as well as fears related to them, that define the era that they were written in, and build a society using them, creating a novel that is not only engaging and though-provoking, but highly relevant to the readers as well.</p>
